</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As if I don't have enough record of carelessness with my Samsung Galaxy S2, dropped it thousands times, and have to praise the lord about how lucky I am that the phone still working fine. Today, I accidentally dropped it into a bucket full of water.</p>
<p>Yes, you hear it right. The rain was heavy for the last to days, and I just found out the ceiling on my apartment is dripping water somewhere around 3AM, right onto my bed when I was sleeping. So I woke up that night, move my bed just a little bit away from the leak, and put a bucket above my floor just right beside my bed so it won't create mini-flood in the morning, and then I went back sleeping. But the story doesn't end happily.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 4.30AM, my phone, which was on my desk, ringing, telling me there's an email coming. I took my phone from my desk and read what it was about, and then, put it on top of my pillow, and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>About a while, I heard something dropping into the bucket of water, loud. Not a usual noise I would hear every night, so I woke up to find what it is, and saw my phone, with a screen on, diving to the deepest level of the bucket, the live wallpaper is glowing just like my eyes when I see that thing is swimming where even in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwgDN1Jss44">commercial it doesn't advice people to allow it</a>. </p>
<p>Half conscious, I jumped and grab my phone, realized it's still on, I shut it down, but keep the case closed, and went back sleep, planned have a further look in the morning. I hold it while I'm sleeping, and not realizing I pressed the power button once again, and turned it on. Only hours after that I realize it because it's warned me about the battery level is low.</p>
<p>So I woke up, shut it down again, and open up the case, put it on a desk where sun light can reach.  Wait for few hours and turn it back on. It started to behave oddly, I put the charger but it doesn't recognize it, restart it few times, then only it recognize the charger I plugged in, but it keeps charging even when I pull the charger out.</p>
<p>Also, Vlingo - SGS2 voice recognition software keeps popping out asking me what would I like to do. So I put the phone off few hours again, and it doesn't turned off, instead it's showing a battery charging screen with a warning about temperature increase, I freaked out.</p>
<p>I hold a phone as well as try to smell something, but I sense nothing's wrong with it's physical condition. And just to make sure everything's fine, I plugged out the battery, and blow all the port with an old-unused hair dryer. Put it back on again.</p>
<p>It doesn't turned on, it still showing the battery charging screen with a temperature warning. Shit.</p>
<p>And then I tried few combination, such as putting the charger while the phone is off, and turn it back on, it works, but heck I'm sure something's wrong.</p>
<p>My carelessness is again giving me a nightmare, the phone still have a warranty, though. So I'm gonna check whether the service center can work something out to fix it, and hopefully, they won't notice how the phone end up like this. </p>
