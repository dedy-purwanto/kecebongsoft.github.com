Title: Reinstating owler.io
Tags: owler.io

You might notice that in the last couple of days, owler.io is not really
functioning. I've turned off the email daemon because I realized
it was too unsecure and it can lead to a big problem when somebody 
register and used it frequently.

The problems were:

-   Same email being received multiple times for no known reason
-   There's no way to tell if the adress being spoofed.

Considering this to big hole, and the fact that I was quite busy with
other stuff latety, I decided to deactivate the email daemon for the
time being and, most importantly, will try to rewrite most of the code
from sratch and publish it to github. I figured out that the second 
point is the most important one as it will allow people to see what's
inside the system, how it treat the their data, keep their privacy
and most importantly, let other contribute when there find any hole.

In a couple days I will prepare what needs to be done and immediately
cast a new repository on github. So stay tuned.
