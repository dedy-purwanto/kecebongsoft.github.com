Title: about me

Hi, my name is Dedi Purwanto, I'm more known with my nickname kecebongsoft.
I know Python, Django, and things around them such Postgres, AWS, cachings, well you know the rest.
Oh, and I'm using linux, rxvt, tmux and vim, in case that matters for you to know.
I currently work for <a href='http://easyuni.com'>EasyUni</a>, a startup company. So far I'm the only guy who code in there.
