Title: about me

Hi, my name is Dedi Purwanto, I'm more known with my nickname kecebongsoft.

I know Python, Django, and things around them such as Postgres, AWS, caching, scaling, deployments, well you know, web and backend stuff.

Oh, and I'm using rxvt, tmux and vim, in case that matters for you to know.

I currently work for <a href='http://easyuni.com'>easyuni</a>, a startup company. Currently I'm the only guy who write code in there.

You can find me through one of these:
