    <p>Recently I've been watching my monthly AWS bill and notice the I/O cost has been increased in the last few months. Note that at this point I've been receiving something around 220 million I/O request on my EBS volume. Earlier this week, Amazon Singapore did an introductory workshop nearby our office and introduces provisioned IOPS. I didn't really paid any attention to it, but it turned out really handy.</p>
<p>IOPS, or IO per second, is a term coined by AWS to allow some resource in EBS volume in order to serve I/O requests, the more you have it, the more you can serve a request in a second. In AWS, there are two flavors of EBS, standard or provisioned, from the latter you will be able to set how many IOPS you want to have in a month, which is called as IOPS-month. 1 IOPS-month is equal to the number of seconds in a month, which is approximately 27 million second, or 27 million IOPS. When looking at my monthly I/O requests, which was 220 million, I can safely provision my IOPS to 100 IOPS which is something around 270 million IOPS per month, a bit higher and also safer in case of sudden peak.</p>
<p>When using a standard I/O request, you will be charged something around 11 cents per 1 million request, and when using provisioned IOPS, you will be charged 11 cents per 1 IOPS-month, this will approximately save $10 a month for I/O requests. Pricing will depends on region, and provisioned storage will cost more for space, but the end cost is cheaper.</p>
<p>So far, the only way to use this provisioned IOPS is by creating a new instance / launching new EBS volume, I haven't figured any way to switch my EBS volume to use a provisioned IOPS. For more info, see the EBS detail page in AWS (http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/).</p>
